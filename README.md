# Atlanta Property Analysis

The goal of this project was to create a real estate valuation tool that properly assessed home values as well as a given homeâ€™s unique features in the city of Atlanta, GA. We looked to cluster homes in Atlanta to create groups of housing with similar traits (i.e. home type, number of floors, proximity to city center) in order to create more accurate valuations through segmentation. In addition to our main deliverable of clustering home types, we our model to identified the most important features of a house to look at when valuing a home. 

The following property features were determined to be significant when valuing a home in Atlanta, Georgia: **number of bedrooms, square footage, year built, number of bathrooms, latitude, number of floors, whether there is a fireplace, whether central heating is used in the property, whether a heat pump is used in the property, whether the exterior of the property is brick, whether the garage is attached, whether the architecture of the property is traditional, and the tax assessed values of the property in 2019, 2020 and 2021**.
