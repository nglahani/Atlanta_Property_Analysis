# real_estate_growth_analysis
As a group, we have decided on the Real Estate industry as our topic of interest. The goal of our project will be to create a real estate valuation tool that properly assesses home values in the US, while also accounting for future growth expectations. These home valuations will then be grouped by major metropolitan regions in the US, and analyzed to identify US housing markets with the most favorable growth opportunities. Our future growth expectations will be built on macroeconomic factors both in the local market and broader US for a given property. In addition to our main deliverable, we also expect our model to identify for us the most important features of a house to look at when valuing a home as a byproduct of our valuation process.
